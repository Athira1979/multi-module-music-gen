🎶 Enhancing AI Music Generation with Multi-Module Neural Networks
A Novel Approach to Chord, Rhythm, and Pitch Synthesis




📌 Overview
Automatic music generation is a rapidly evolving area in artificial intelligence, but current approaches often struggle to:

Capture temporal dependencies across sequences

Maintain harmonic coherence

Generate dynamic rhythmic patterns effectively

This project introduces a Multi-Module Neural Network (MNN) for automatic music composition, combining several specialized modules:

🎼 Temporal Graph Dilated Convolution (TGDC): Captures chord progression dependencies.

🥁 Rhythm Generator (MobileNet-TCN): Creates expressive rhythmic patterns.

🎹 Pitch Generator (Sparse Transformer): Generates coherent pitch sequences aligned with rhythm.

🎶 Fusion & Post-Processing: Merges rhythm and pitch while refining timing, velocity, and harmonic structure.

The result is a highly expressive, scalable music generation system that outputs MIDI files or audio-ready compositions.

🚀 Features
Multi-module neural architecture for chords, rhythm, and pitch
